UncleJim ("**Un**modifiable **Coll**ections for **J**avaâ„¢ **Imm**utability") is a small library that enables a cleaner, safer style of Java programming.  It approaches a domain specific language (DSL) inside Java.

```java
// Define some people with lists of email addresses on the
// fly.  vec() makes a List, tup() makes a Tuple
vec(tup("Jane", "Smith", vec("a@b.c", "b@c.d")),
    tup("Fred", "Tase", vec("c@d.e", "d@e.f", "e@f.g")))

        // Turn that into pairs of emails and people:
        // flatMap() the list of people into a list of
        // emails.  map() the emails to email/person pairs
        // while the person object is still in scope.
        .flatMap(person -> person._3()
                                 .map(mail -> tup(mail,
                                                  person)))

        // toImMap() expects a function that maps items to
        // key/value pairs.  We already have pairs, so pass
        // it the identity function.
        .toImMap(x -> x)

        // Look up Jane by her address
        .get("b@c.d")

        // Get her first name (returns "Jane")
        ._1();
```

#Features

* Type-safe versions of Clojure's immutable collections, implementing the generic `java.util` collection interfaces.
* A simplified immutable alternative to Java 8 Streams, wrapping checked exceptions and avoiding primitives.
* A tiny, type-safe data definition language of brief helper functions: `vec()`, `set()`, `map()`, and `tup()`, (like Clojure's vector `[]`, set `#{}`, and map `{}`).
* Extend Tuples to make your own immutable Java classes (with correct `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` implementations) almost as easily as writing case classes in Scala.

UncleJim takes advantages of Java's type inferencing by avoiding void return types, arrays, primatives, and checked exceptions in lambdas.  It can decrease the amount of code you need to write by a factor of at 2x-3x while focusing you on using the right collections for the fastest possible code.

#Details

Usage examples are implemented as unit tests to ensure that they remain correct and current.

* [Usage examples](src/test/java/org/organicdesign/fp/UsageExampleTest.java#L34) - different ways of improving your Java code with UncleJim.

* [Comparison with Traditional Java and Java 8 Streams](src/test/java/org/organicdesign/fp/TradJavaStreamComparisonTest.java#L22)

* [Class/Interface Hierarchy](inheritanceHierarchy.pdf) (PDF)

* For complete API documentation, please build the javadoc: `mvn javadoc:javadoc`

* [JimTrainer self-guided training](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/JimTrainer) consists of a few short problem-sets for learning UncleJim

* A summary of recent updates is in the [Change Log](changeLog.md)

#Manifesto

* Immutability promotes correct code as much as type safety does.
* Better to focus on picking the appropriate collections and transformations than on looping details.
* Write functions before defining classes, yet still take advantage of type safety.
* On-the fly data definition should be simple and easy.  Naming/formalizing those data structures should be too.
* Minimal, easy-to-understand interface covering the most critical building blocks for higher functionality.

#FAQ

##Q: How does this compare to PCollections?

[UncleJim is based on Clojure, theoretically faster and has additional features](wiki/UncleJim%20vs.%20PCollections)

##Q: Do these Transforms create intermediate collections between each operation (like the Scala collections)?

[No](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/UncleJim/wiki/How-do-%22Xforms%22---Transformations-work%3F)

##Q: How does this compare to Streams and lambda expressions in JDK8?
