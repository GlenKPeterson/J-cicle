<p>This package contains Option which has Some() and None() which is useful for indicating "Not-Found"
    or "End-of-stream/file".  It also has Or which has Good() and Bad() for functional error
    handling.  A third option is to roll-your own union-type wrappers.</p>

<p>The OneOf classes in this package approximates union types for Java - for when an object can be exactly one of a few different types.
    Java has specifically avoided union types in favor of defining a super-type and making all interchangeable types
    implement it.  That's still the easiest way to go when practical.
    But sometimes you don't have control of the two types to make them inherit from a common ancestor.
    Maybe one hierarchy makes sense in one context and another hierarchy makes sense in another?
    Should you write code like this?</p>

<pre><code>
// Ugly, hard to read, and awkward to use.
// Plus, coding mistakes are caught at runtime.
String showThing(String s, Integer i) {
    if (s == null) {
        if (i == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Exactly one argument should not be null, but both were");
        } else {
            return "an int: " + i;
        }
    } else if (i != null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Exactly one argument should be null, but neither were");
    }
    return "a string: " + s;
}</code></pre>

<p>How much work is it to read that code?  What if there were more than 2 types?  This is a problem.
    Union types are the answer.</p>

<p>If your return value can be a User or a Group, you no longer have to code it as Object and make the client
    cast to one or the other.  What if the client forgets that your method can return a Group and only codes for User?
    What if one day, you can return a User, or a Group, or a Company?
    Union types force the client to deal with all these possibilities before their code can compile.
    If you add or remove a type, all client code will show compile-time errors until updated to deal with the change.

<p>Really, we want to move to a type system where types are sets.
    ML had this in 1990.
    Then Object Oriented programming took the world by storm and types without Objects waned.
    In retrospect, we may have missed something.</p>

<p>Here's an example using OneOf2.
    This forces all client code to handle both types: type safety, outside the class hierarchy.</p>

<pre><code>
// You need to subclass a OneOf class with your own class like this:
static class Str_Int extends OneOf2&lt;String,Integer&gt; {
    // Constructor
    private Str_Int(Object o, int n) { super(o, String.class, Integer.class, n); }

    // Static Factory Methods:
    // Make sure to use consecutive integers starting from zero
    // for the second constructor argument.  These ints represent
    // indices that select the classes you passed to the call to
    // super() above.  So String uses index 0:
    static Str_Int ofStr(String o) { return new Str_Int(o, 0); }

    // Integer uses index 1:
    static Str_Int ofInt(Integer o) { return new Str_Int(o, 1); }
}

// Now create a new instance with your factory
Str_Int soi = Str_Int.ofInt(57);

// Finally, use your new instance.  Notice that this forces you
// to account for all cases of what the union type could contain.
// The return types of the match() function is the same as the return
// type of the lambdas you pass to it (they all have to match).  In this
// case, that type is String.
return "This is " + soi.match(str -> "a string: " + str,
                              i   -> "an integer: " + i));</code></pre>

<p>Another great example is iText.
    What if you just want to add a child item to whatever kind of parent you have?
    You know there can only be 4 parents, but they are unrelated classes: Document, Paragraph, Li, and Cell.
    You could petition iText to make them implement a common interface, but that could take time.
    If you use "if" statements everywhere in your code, you might forget one case.
    The following example casts objects inside every "if" and does unnecessary "instanceof" checks at runtime</p>

<pre><code>
// Ugly, hard to read, and coding mistakes are caught at runtime.
if (parent instanceof Document) {
    Document doc = (Document) parent;
    // Add a new paragraph
    doc.add(new Paragraph(textRenderable));
} else if (parent instanceof Paragraph) {
    Paragraph para = (Paragraph) parent;
    // Just add text to existing paragraph
    para.add(textRenderable);
} else if (parent instanceof Cell) {
    Cell cell = (Cell) parent;
    // Add a new paragraph
    cell.add(new Paragraph(textRenderable));
} else {
    // Defensive coding.  This may not be eligible for test coverage.
    throw new IllegalStateException("Coded for parent to be a Document, Paragraph, or Cell but found: " +
                                    (parent == null) ? "null" : parent.getClass().getCanonicalName());
}
</code></pre>

<p>What if you don't use Cells any more?  Dead code.
    What if you forget to code for some type?  Runtime Bugs.
    What if parent can be some additional type in the future, like a Table?  Runtime Bugs.</p>

<p>There's a better way.</p>

<pre><code>
public static class Doc_Para_Li_Cell
        extends OneOf3&lt;Document,Paragraph,Cell&gt; {

    // Constructor
    protected Doc_Para_Li_Cell(Object o, int s) {
        super(o, Document.class, Paragraph.class, Cell.class, s);
    }

    // Static factory methods
    public static Doc_Para_Li_Cell ofDoc(Document document) {
        return new Doc_Para_Li_Cell(document, 0);
    }
    public static Doc_Para_Li_Cell ofPara(Paragraph p) { return new Doc_Para_Li_Cell(p, 1); }
    public static Doc_Para_Li_Cell ofCell(Cell c) { return new Doc_Para_Li_Cell(c, 2); }
}</code></pre>

<p>Now in your code, when you want to add a bunch of text, you can do it the right way for each.  No casts,
    no instanceOf, no fuss:</p>

<pre><code>
parent.match(doc -> { doc.add(new Paragraph(textRenderable)); return null; },
             para -> { para.add(textRenderable); return null; },
             cell -> { cell.add(new Paragraph(textRenderable)); return null; });</code></pre>

<p>In this example, you have to have the same return type for each.
    Since we don't care about a return value, we return null in each function.
    What happens if some combination is sometimes invalid?
    Throw an exception (catching the illegal state at runtime is better than ignoring it,
    and it's only one runtime issue, instead of the many in previous examples):</p>

<pre><code>
parent.match(doc -> { doc.add(table); return null; },
             para -> { throw new IllegalStateException("Can't add a table to a paragraph."); },
             cell -> { cell.add(table); return null; });</code></pre>

<p>Now if you decide not to use Cells any more, you switch Doc_Para_Li_Cell to extend OneOf2, rename it to Doc_Para_Li
    and fix all the compile-time errors.  To add a Table type, extend OneOf4.
    No dead code.  No bugs.
    Union types extend type safety outside the object hierarchy.
    I'd love to see this added to Java or Kotlin someday.
    Well, Kotlin already has it for nulls, just not in the general case.</p>

<p>If you like Paguro and are interested in a new JVM and maybe compile-to-JavaScript language
    with Union and Intersection types instead of Object Oriented hierarchies, take a look at the
    evolving spec for the
    <a href="https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/Cymling" target="_blank">Cymling</a> programming
    language.  It may need some help to become reality.</p>
