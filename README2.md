# Notice
Read [README.md](README.md) before this file as that is the official introduction to Paguro.
This file contains additional information for contributors, or maybe people who are considering opening an issue.

# Additional features:
* Simplified [functional interfaces](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/function) that wrap checked exceptions
* An [Equator](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/collections/Equator.java) and [ComparisonContext](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/collections/Equator.java#L45) which work like `java.util.Comparator`, but for hash-based collections.
* [Memoization](src/main/java/org/organicdesign/fp/function/Fn2.java#L59) for functions
* Unmodifiable interfaces which deprecate mutator methods and throw exceptions to retrofit legacy code and catch errors in your IDE instead of at runtime.
These were useful before the Clojure collections and Transformable were fully integrated, but may still provide a useful extension point for integrating your own immutable collections into the traditional Java ecosystem.

# Thank You
Some of the people I'm listing as contributors may not actually be aware of this project, but I found them inspiring in various ways.

As Norm Zeck pointed out by sending me [Ropes: an Alternative to Strings](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.9450&rep=rep1&type=pdf), an RRB-Tree might make a great implementation of *both* String and StringBuilder.  We might want to add a Char8 (UTF-8 Character class pronounced "crate") and make Str8 (UTF-8 String pronounced "straight") a sub-class of RRB-Tree.  Just a thought.

The bulk of this project started as a simple question on StackExchange: [Why doesn't Java 8 include immutable collections?](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/221762/why-doesnt-java-8-include-immutable-collections)  People's answers were a big help in figuring out what this project should and shouldn't do.

Paul Philips [Scala Collections talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiJycy6dFSQ&t=26m19s) was a huge inspiration to me.  I watched it over and over and tried to learn from his experience as much as possible.

Context-sensitive equality: prefer Equator and Comparator to <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashcode()</code> and <code>compareTo()</code> ([Daniel Spiewak, Viktor Klang, Rúnar Óli Bjarnason, Hughes Chabot](http://glenpeterson.blogspot.com/2013/09/object-equality-is-context-relative.html), java.util.TreeSet, java.util.TreeMap)

# Think about:
 - Xform.MapDesc is not serializable.  Really none of xform is serializable.
 - Think about adding StaticImports.xform(String)
 - Add insert(int i, E element) to ImList, implemented by wrapping the existing list in an ImSortedMap and time it.
 - Can I make UnmodMap extend UnmodCollection instead of UnmodIterable?  Or do the contains() and contains() all methods conflict?
   Hmm... Maybe have a SizedIterable that both maps and collections can extend?  Ditto UnmodSortedMap extend UnmodSortedCollection instead of UnmodSortedIterable.
 - Have an Ordered version of Transform as well as the (default) unreliable order.  Only the ordered version can be used for implementing things like equals() and hashCode()
 - Implement drop() for list with listIterator(dropAmount)
 - Study monadic thinking and ensure that Or is "monad-friendly".
 Ensure you can chain together functions in a short-circuiting way, without exceptions or other side-effects.
 - Replace vector with RRBTree (assuming performance is good).
 - Re-implement Persistent collections under the Apache license.
 - Make pretty(int indent) methods on everything that returns a String of valid Cymling code to create that collection.

# Out of Scope

### Option<T> firstMatching(Predicate<T> pred);
Use with filter(...).head() instead

### T reduceLeft(BiFunction<T, T, T> fun)
reduceLeft() is like fold without the "u" parameter.
I implemented it, but deleted it because it seemed like a very special case of fold that only operated on items of the same type as the original collection.
I didn't think it improved readability or ease of use to have both methods.
How hard is it to pass a 0 or 1 to fold?
It's easy enough to implement if there is a compelling use case where it's significantly better than fold.
Otherwise, fewer methods means a simpler interface to learn.

### Transformable<T> forEach(Fn1<? super T,?> consumer)
Java 8 has `void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action)` on both Iterable and Stream that does what
Transformable.forEach() used to do.  The old Transformable method overloaded (but did not override)
this method which is problematic for the reasons Josh Bloch gives in his Item 41.  Either make
use of the Java 8 `void forEach(i -> log(i))` or pass a constant function like
`i -> { print(i); return Boolean.TRUE; }` to
`Transformable<T> filter(Fn1<? super T,Boolean> predicate)` instead. 

### Transformable<T> interpose(T item)
I also implemented interpose(), but took it out because my only use case was to add commas to a list to display
it in English and for that, you also need a conjunction, and often a continuation symbol:

a, b, c, or d.

a, b, c, and d.

a,b,c...

None of those are simple uses of interpose.

### Mirroring Clojure's seq (sequence abstraction)

Paguro tried two alternatives.  One was based on the Clojure idea of a sequence: immutable, lazy, and cached.  The signature looked something like this:

```java
interface Sequence1<T> {
    Option<T> first();
    Sequence1<T> rest();
}
```

Unfortunately, at 30 Million items it was at least 30x slower than using Iterators.  Another attempt was a single-shot, but still thread-safe, sequence that wraps each item in an Option.  You would check whether that Option is None to see if you've passed the last element or not.  This attempt was only about 3x slower than native iterators.

```java
interface Sequence2<T> {
    Option<T> next();
}
```

Ultimately, Transformable took the place of a sequence abstraction in Paguro.  It's safe, easy to use, and about 98% as fast as native Java iteration.  If you really need to pretend you have a Sequence1, Transformable has `take(1)` and `drop(1)` that you can use like `first()` and `rest()` in a pinch.  That said, everything you could do with Sequence1 you can do faster and just as clearly with Transformable.  Presumably, this is why Clojure now has Transducers.

# Motivation

## Executive summary
To be able to write Java at work more like the way I write Clojure without taking any significant performance penalty for doing so.  Also, to be able to use the Clojure collections in a type-safe language.  I was thinking "Java" but really Scala can take advantage of the type safety improvements as well.

## Details
The goals of this project are to make it easy to use Java:

 - Immutably (Josh Bloch "Effective Java" 2nd Edition Item 15 and Clojure)
 - Type safely (Josh Bloch Item 23)
 - Functionally (using first-class functions more easily: Clojure and Scala)
 - Expressiveness/Brevity (Expressions over statements: all API calls evaluate to something useful for subsequent calls: Clojure and Scala).
 - Minimizing the use of primitives and arrays (except for varargs in 3 places, Suggested by Josh Bloch Items 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, also Clojure and Scala)
 - Returning empty collections instead of <code>null</code> (Josh Bloch Item 43, also Clojure and Scala)
 - "Throw exceptions at people, not at code" (says Bill Venners, but also Josh Bloch Item 59)
 - Concurrency friendly (Josh Bloch Item 66, 67)
 - Context-sensitive equality: prefer Equator and Comparator to <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashcode()</code> and <code>compareTo()</code> ([Daniel Spiewak, Viktor Klang, Rúnar Óli Bjarnason, Hughes Chabot](http://glenpeterson.blogspot.com/2013/09/object-equality-is-context-relative.html), java.util.TreeSet, java.util.TreeMap)
 - Sensible toString() implementations (like Scala)
 - Compatibly with existing/legacy Java code

Higher order functions are not just briefer to write and read, they are less to *think* about.
They are useful abstractions that simplify code and focus your attention on your goals rather than the details of how to accomplish them.
Function chaining: <code>xs.map(x -> x + 1).filter(x -> x > 7).head()</code> defines what you are doing in the simplest possible way while hiding all details about how to iterate through the underlying collection.

The alternative - loops - are bundles of unnecessary complexity.
Loops generally require setting up accumulators, then running a gamut of <code>if</code>, <code>break</code>, and <code>continue</code> statements, like some kind of mad obstacle race that involves as many state changes as possible.
Different kinds of collections require different looping constructs - more complexity.
Looping code is vulnerable to "off-by-one" boundary overflow/underflow, improper initialization, accidental exit, infinite loops, forgetting to update a counter, updating the wrong counter...  The list goes on!
None of that has anything to do with why the loop was created in the first place which is to transform the underlying data.

You don't have to write that kind of code any more.
If you want to map one set of values according to a given function, say so with xs.map().
Filter?  xs.filter().
It's clearer, simpler, and like type safety, it eliminates whole classes of errors.

Clojure works like this, only the syntax makes the evaluation go inside out from the order you read the statements in (hence Clojure's two arrow operators).
With method chaining, the evaluation happens in the same order as the methods are written on the page, much like piping commands to one another in shell scripts.

The Xform class is the third one of its kind that I have written.  For a single thread, my timings show that its speed is comparable to a for loop.  In general, the overhead for using these transformations is minimal or non-existant.  In the cases where imutability does cause overhead (and there definitely are) it is generally well worth the clarity, safety, and productivity benefits it provides.
If you find a better/faster implementation, please submit your improvements!

Within your own FP-centric world, you will use the Im interfaces and implementations and transform them with the Transformation abstraction.  Methods that interact with imperative Java code will take the java.util interfaces and return either the Im- interfaces (or Un- interfaces) as necessary.

In Java, variables declared outside a lambda and used within one must be effectively finial.  The Mutable.Ref class works around this limitation.
